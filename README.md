## Create Journal Entries & Compendiums
Currently only supports card images. 
1. Create a uploads/ folder in your Foundry data directory (or call it whatever else it doesn't matter)
2. Go to Journal tab, new button will be there to do a Deck Import. Choose a new folder name that all the imports will be classified under, select all the card images you want to be turned into journal entries, and then specify the path that those files will be put in. 
3. Click Import, this will create journal entries for everything and create a compendium with those journal entries
  
## Create Roll Table from Compendium
1. Go to Roll Table, type in the Compendium Name (for developers out there, this is meant to be intutive, so it's the pack.metadata.label, not actually pack.metadata.name)
2. Type in the name of the rolltable you want

Enjoy.
